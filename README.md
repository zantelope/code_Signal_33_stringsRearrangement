# code_Signal_33_stringsRearrangement

Given an array of equal-length strings, check if it is possible to rearrange the strings in such a way that after the rearrangement the strings at consecutive positions would differ by exactly one character.

Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "bbb", "bab"], the output should be
stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = false.

All rearrangements don't satisfy the description condition.

For inputArray = ["ab", "bb", "aa"], the output should be
stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = true.

Strings can be rearranged in the following way: "aa", "ab", "bb".
